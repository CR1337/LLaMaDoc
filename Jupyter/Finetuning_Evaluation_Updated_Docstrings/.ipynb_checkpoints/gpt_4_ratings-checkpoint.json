    "### Evaluation:\n\n**Docstring-0:**\n- **Rating:** Very Poor\n- **Reasoning:**\n  - This docstring does not describe what the function does at all.\n  - It seems to be a nonsensical sentence that is irrelevant to the `compute_gradients` function.\n  - It doesn't follow any standard docstring format and lacks essential components like arguments, return type, and detailed description.\n\n**Docstring-1:**\n- **Rating:** Excellent\n- **Reasoning:**\n  - This docstring accurately describes what the function does by mentioning that it computes gradients with respect to the model's parameters.\n  - It specifies the parameters (`*args` and `**kwargs`) and their purpose.\n  - The return type is clearly described, including the structure of the returned list (tuples of gradients and corresponding variables).\n  - The information is clearly written and follows a commonly accepted docstring format.\n\n**Docstring-2:**\n- **Rating:** Poor\n- **Reasoning:**\n  - This docstring uses reStructuredText Sphinx-style syntax but lacks any meaningful description of the function.\n  - It does not provide any useful information about what the arguments are and what the function returns.\n  - It fails to convey the purpose of the function or give any practical understanding of how the function should be used.\n\n### Conclusion:\n`Docstring-1` is clearly the best among the provided examples.\n\n```python\nprint('docstring-1_better')\n```",
    "### Ratings and Reasoning:\n\n#### Docstring-0:\n**Rating: 1/10**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- The description given in Docstring-0 is completely unrelated to the provided code. \n- The code initializes a class called `Mixup` and sets values for `alpha` and `beta`, whereas the docstring is talking about replacing non-padding symbols with their position numbers.\n\n#### Docstring-1:\n**Rating: 0/10**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Docstring-1 is empty, which provides absolutely no information or context about the function.\n- It doesn\u2019t meet any of the standards of a good docstring, which should describe the method's purpose and the role of its parameters.\n\n#### Docstring-2:\n**Rating: 4/10**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Docstring-2 starts the right way by listing the parameters `alpha` and `beta`, which matches the function signature.\n- However, it misses descriptions for these parameters, which are crucial for understanding what they represent and their expected values.\n- A more appropriate docstring should describe what `alpha` and `beta` are used for and mention that they need to be positive numbers.\n\nGiven that none of the docstrings adequately describe the function, but Docstring-2 is at least minimally aligned with the parameters' listing:\n\n```python\nprint('none_fit')\n```",
    "### Docstring-0 Evaluation\n\nThis docstring is completely unrelated to the provided function `_IsFlag`. \n- **Mismatch**: It describes adding a frame to a video file stream, mentioning a numpy array and a frame count, which has nothing to do with checking a flag.\n- **Appropriateness**: 0/10\n\n### Docstring-1 Evaluation\n\nThis docstring is concise and accurately describes the purpose of the function `_IsFlag`.\n- **Accuracy**: It mentions that the function checks whether an argument is a single or multi-character flag.\n- **Brevity**: It's short and to the point, which is good for such a simple function.\n- **Appropriateness**: 9/10\n\n### Docstring-2 Evaluation\n\nThis docstring is non-existent.\n- **Accuracy**: Cannot rate.\n- **Completeness**: 0/10\n- **Appropriateness**: 0/10\n\nBased on the evaluations above:\n\n```plaintext\nnone_fit\n```"
